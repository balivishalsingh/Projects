          <h2>Indian lawyer, politician, social activist, and writer</h2>
          <p>
            <b>who employed nonviolent resistance to</b> lead the successful
            campaign for India's independence from British rule. He inspired
            movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The
            honorific Mahātmā (from Sanskrit, meaning great-souled, or
            venerable), first applied to him in South Africa in 1914, is now
            used throughout the world.[2] Born and raised in a Hindu family in
            coastal Gujarat, Gandhi trained in the law at the Inner Temple in
            London and was called to the bar at the age of 22. After two
            uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start a successful
            law practice, Gandhi moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an
            Indian merchant in a lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for
            21 years. Here, Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent
            resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he
            returned to India and soon set about organising peasants, farmers,
            and urban labourers to protest against discrimination and excessive
            land tax.
